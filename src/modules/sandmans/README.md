## Why this name? (sandman)

```
'Sandman' is a mythical character in central and northern European folklore
who brings good dreams by sprinkling magical sand onto the eyes of children
while they sleep at night.

He is said to sprinkle sand or dust on or into the eyes of the child at night
to bring on dreams and sleep. The grit or "sleep" in one's eyes upon waking is
supposed to be the result of the Sandman's work the previous evening.

But I personally think, that if someone sprinkle sand into your eyes you'll
wake up  to see what happens ;) - This is exactly what we're looking for :p
